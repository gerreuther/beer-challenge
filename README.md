This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, you will need to run the backend server from the backend project so that the endpoints used here are available.
Navigate to the project's folder and run:

```bash
npm install
```

Then run the development server with any of the following commands:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev

```

I recommend to use yarn to avoid occasional npm problems with the latest version of Next.js.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Google Fonts.

For the challenge purposes, the root URL redirects to the PLP page at /products.
